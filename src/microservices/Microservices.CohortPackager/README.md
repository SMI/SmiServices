### 1. Overview

Collects all information regarding an extraction job, and monitors the filesystem for the anonymised files. Persists all information to a MongoDB collection.

Produces validation reports for each extraction suitable for review by research coordinators before the extraction files are released. See [reports section](#6-reports). Reports are created automatically when an extraction is detected as being complete, and can also be manually recreated on the CLI by passing the `-r` or `--recreate-reports` flag with the corresponding extraction GUID.

### 2. Setup / Installation

- Clone the project and build. Any NuGet dependencies should be automatically downloaded
- Setup a yaml file with the configuration for your environment
- Run `CohortPackager.exe` with your yaml config

### 3. Exchange and Queue Settings

| Read/Write | Type | Config setting |
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
|Read|ExtractRequestMessage|`DicomReprocessorOptions.ExtractRequestInfoOptions`|
|Read|ExtractRequestInfoMessage|`DicomReprocessorOptions.ExtractFilesInfoOptions`|
|Read|ExtractFileStatusMessage | `DicomReprocessorOptions.AnonImageStatusOptions` |

### 4. Config

| YAML Section  | Purpose |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|JobWatcherTickrate|How often the filesystem is checked for anonymised files (in seconds)|

### 5. Expectations

Errors are [logged as normal for a MicroserviceHost](../../common/Smi.Common/README.md#logging)

### 6. Reports

When an extraction is completed, report(s) are created detailing any errors or validation failures relating to the set of files that have been produced. There are currently 2 formats:
-   `Combined`. A single file useful for smaller extractions which can be manually reviewed. Format:
    ```markdown
    # SMI extraction validation report for testProj1/extract1

    --- end of report ---
    ```

-   `Split`. A pack (directory) of files which can be used for larger extractions to script the review process by reading them into external analysis tools. 6 files are currently produced for each extraction:
    -   `README.md`. Summary information for the extract
        ```markdown
        # SMI extraction validation report for testProj1/extract1

```markdown
