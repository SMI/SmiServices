### 1. Overview

Collects all information regarding an extraction job, and monitors the filesystem for the anonymised files. Persists all information to a MongoDB collection.

Produces validation reports for each extraction suitable for review by research coordinators before the extraction files are released. See [reports section](#6-reports). Reports are created automatically when an extraction is detected as being complete, and can also be manually recreated on the CLI by passing the `-r` or `--recreate-reports` flag with the corresponding extraction GUID.

### 2. Setup / Installation

- Clone the project and build. Any NuGet dependencies should be automatically downloaded
- Setup a yaml file with the configuration for your environment
- Run `CohortPackager.exe` with your yaml config

### 3. Exchange and Queue Settings

| Read/Write | Type | Config setting |
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
|Read|ExtractRequestMessage|`DicomReprocessorOptions.ExtractRequestInfoOptions`|
|Read|ExtractRequestInfoMessage|`DicomReprocessorOptions.ExtractFilesInfoOptions`|
|Read|ExtractFileStatusMessage | `DicomReprocessorOptions.AnonImageStatusOptions` |

### 4. Config

| YAML Section  | Purpose |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|JobWatcherTickrate|How often the filesystem is checked for anonymised files (in seconds)|

### 5. Expectations

Errors are [logged as normal for a MicroserviceHost](../../common/Smi.Common/README.md#logging)

### 6. Reports

When an extraction is completed, a set of files are created detailing any errors or validation failures relating to the set of files that have been produced.

For a standard extraction, 4 files are produced:
-   `README.md` - A summary file containing metadata about the extraction job
-   `rejections.csv` - A list of any requested IDs which generated a rejection (a file was blocked etc.)
-   `processing_errors.md` - A summary of any errors from the anonymiser or other components in the pipeline. This report should be inspected by a developer before data are released
-   `verification_failures.csv` - A full listing of all `Failure`s generated by IsIdentifiable when scanning files after anonymisation

For an identifiable extraction, 2 files are produced:
-   `README.md` - A summary file containing metadata about the extraction job
-   `rejections.csv` - Similar to above, but will list any IDs which matched files that could not be found on disk
