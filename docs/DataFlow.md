# Data Flow

## Background

This document describes the flow of DICOM tag and pixel data through the SmiServices system. This is an example deployment scenario, the actual implementation can be tailored according to needs.

These include technical tags (some of which are not loaded to Relational / used in cohort building), date tags, anonymised patient ID e.g. 12% of original tags                                                                               |
| Researcher Zone (from NLP) | DICOM files containing full clinical reports (e.g. Dose Reports, Structured Reports). These reports would need to be be anonymised with a dedicated NLP tool as free text report redacting is not something CTP is set up to do. A high proportion of the clinical report content would need to remain in these files for most free text research activities e.g. 98% |
