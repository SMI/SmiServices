    -   For identifiable extractions, the NoSuffixProjectPathResolver is now
        used
-   Validation reports can now be created as either "Combined" (single report as
    before" or "Split" (a
    [pack](src/microservices/Microservices.CohortPackager/README.md) of reports
    including CSVs suitable for post-processing). This is configurable in the
    YAML config and can also be specified on the CLI when recreating reports for
    an extraction
-   Added JobCompletedAt to the validation reports

        been tested
    -   RabbitMQ extraction config has been refactored. Queues and service
        config files need to be updated
-   Add [SecurityCodeScan](https://security-code-scan.github.io/) tool to build
    chain for .NET code
-   Add "no filters" extraction support. If specified when running ExtractorCLI,
    no file rejection filters will be applied by CohortExtractor. True by
    default for identifiable extractions
-   Added caching of values looked up in NLP/rulesbase for IsIdentifiable tool
-   Added new rejector that throws out values (e.g. patient IDs) whose IDs are
    stored in a database table. Set `RejectColumnInfos` option in yaml to enable
    this
-   Added a check to QueryToExecuteResult for RejectReason being null when
    Reject is true.

### Changed

-   [breaking] Environment variables are no longer required. Previous settings
    now appear in configuration file
    -   Environment variable `SMI_LOGS_ROOT` is now `GlobalOptions.LogsRoot`
    -   Environment variable `MONGO_SERVICE_PASSWORD` is now
        `MongoDbOptions.Password`

-   IsIdentifiable Reviewer 'Symbols' rule factory now supports digits only or
    characters only mode (e.g. use `\d` for digits but leave characters
    verbatim)
-   IsIdentifiable Reviewer 'symbols' option when building Regex now builds
    capture groups and matches only the failing parts of the input string not
    the full ProblemValue. For example `MR Head 12-11-20` would return
    `(\d\d-\d\d-\d\d)$`

    -   This includes an upgrade to fo-dicom from `4.0.1` to `4.0.4`
-   Upgraded fo-dicom.Drawing from `4.0.1` to `4.0.4`
-   Upgraded HIC.RdmpDicom from `2.0.7` to `2.0.8`

## [1.6.0] - 2020-03-17

### Changed

-   Update CohortPackager for new extraction design

    -   Consume messages from CTP (failed anonymisation) and IsIdentifiable
        (verification)
    -   Add support for extraction by modality
    -   Remove the final check for the anonymised file. IsIdentifiable handles
        this already
    -   Refactor tests

-   Start to refactor core RabbitMqAdapter code to allow unit testing

## [1.5.2] - 2020-03-12

### Added

-   IsIdentifiableReviewer considers rule capture groups when performing
    redactions (e.g. can now handle custom rules like `^(Ninewells)`)
-   IsIdentifiableReviewer adds comment with time/user to rules file e.g.
    `#TZNind - 3/10/2020 1:17:17 PM`
-   IsIdentifiableReviewer checks custom patterns match the original Failure
-   IsIdentifiable microservice was started with --service but can now be
    started with the service verb allowing it to take additional options. It
    should now be started with `service -y file.yaml`
-   IsIdentifiable no longer reads Rules.yaml from the current directory. It now
    has a command line option --RulesDirectory, to go with the already existing
    --RulesFile. That will read all \*.yaml files in the given directory.
    However when run as a microservice the yaml file specifies a DataDirectory;
    the RulesDirectory will implicitly be a subdirectory called
    IsIdentifiableRules from which all \*.yaml files will be read.

### Changed

-   IsIdentifiableReviewer now tries to isolate 'Problem Words' when generating
    it's suggested Updater Regex rules (e.g. now suggests `^Ninewells` instead
    of `^Ninewells\ Spike\ CT$`.)

## [1.5.1] - 2020-03-06

-   Improved usability of IsIdentifiableReviewer

## [1.5.0] - 2020-03-05

-   \[Breaking\] Updated RabbitMQ extraction config to match extraction plan v2
-   Refactor Java exception handling and use of threads
-   `TessDirectory` option in [IsIdentifiable] now expects tesseract models file
    to exist (no longer downloads it on demand)
-   Added support for outsourcing classification (e.g. NLP) to other processes
    via TCP (entered in [SocketRules] in `Rules.yaml`)
-   IsIdentifiable NLP text classification now outsourced via TCP to any
    services configured in
    -   [StanfordNER implementation written in java](./src/microservices/uk.ac.dundee.hic.nerd/README.md)
-   New CohortExtractor yaml config option `ProjectPathResolverType` which
    determines the folder structure for extracted images
-   Added [script](./utils/rabbitmq-config-tester/rabbitmq-config-tester.py) to
    verify RabbitMQ config files
-   Added `DynamicRejector` which takes its cohort extraction rules from a
    script file (of CSharp code)
-   Added new application for reviewing IsIdentifiable output files

### Fixed

-   Corrected the GetHashCode implementation in the MessageHeader class

-   Add clean shutdown hook for IdentifierMapper to clean up the worker threads

## [1.4.4] - 2020-02-25

-   Update Travis config and Java library install shell script to resolve some
    Travis stability issues
-   Adjust batching so workers queue replies/acks while a worker thread commits
    those asynchronously, allowing elastic batch sizes (qosprefetch setting now
    controls maximum batch size, parallelism capped at 50)

## [1.4.3] - 2020-02-21

### Changed

-   Batch up RabbitMQ messages/acks in IdentifierMapper to avoid contention with
    the message publishing persistence

## [1.4.2] - 2020-02-18

### Added

-   Added unit test for AccessionDirectoryLister as part of
    DicomDirectoryProcessor tests

### Changed

-   Make performance counters in RedisSwapper atomic for thread-safety
-   Clean up threads when using threaded mode in RabbitMQAdapter
-   Use explicit threads rather than Task queueing in IdentifierMapper

## [1.4.1] - 2020-02-17

### Added

-   Added randomisation in the retry delay on DicomRelationalMapper (and set
    minimum wait duration to 10s)

### Fixed

-   Fixed DLE Payload state being wrong when retrying batches (when it is half /
    completely consumed)
-   Added lock on producer sending messages in IdentifierMapper

## [1.4.0] - 2020-02-14

### Added

-   Added in memory caching of the last 1024 values when using Redis wrapper for
    an IdentifierSwapper
-   Added some parallelism and marshalling of backend queries to improve
    throughput in IdentifierSwapper
-   Added temporary flag for RabbitMQAdapter parallelism for the above. Only
    enabled for the IdentifierMapper for now
-   Added new mode to DicomDirectoryProcessor which allows reading in a list of
    accession directories

## [1.3.1] - 2020-02-13

### Changed

-   Pinned fo-dicom to v4.0.1

## [1.3.0] - 2020-02-06

### Added

-   Added (optional) DicomFileSize property to ETL pipeline. Add to template(s)
    with:

```yaml
- ColumnName: DicomFileSize
  AllowNulls: true
  Type:
      CSharpType: System.Int64
```

-   Added new microservice IsIdentifiable which scans for personally
    identifiable information (in databases and dicom files)
-   Added support for custom rules in IsIdentifiable (entered in `Rules.yaml`)
    -   Rules are applied in the order they appear in this file
    -   Rules are applied before any other classifiers (i.e. to allow
        whitelisting rules)
-   Added `RedisSwapper` which caches answers from any other swapper. Set
    `RedisHost` option in yaml to use.

### Changed

-   Updated RDMP and Dicom plugins
-   Refactor Java exception handling and use of threads

## [1.2.3] - 2020-01-09

### Changed

-   RabbitMQAdapter: Improve handling of timeouts on connection startup

### Added

-   Improved logging in IdentifierSwappers

### Changed

-   Guid swapper no longer limits input identifiers to a maximum of 10
    characters

### Fixed

-   Fixed DicomRelationalMapper not cleaning up STAGING table remnants from
    previously failed loads (leading to crash)

## [1.2.2] - 2020-01-08

### Fixed

-   RAW to STAGING migration now lists columns explicitly (previously used
    `SELECT *` which could cause problems if RAW and STAGING column orders
    somehow differed)

## [1.2.1] - 2020-01-06

### Added

-   Added the `set-sleep-time-ms` control message to DicomReprocessor

-   Added better CLI argument descriptions for DicomReprocessor
-   Added error logging for RabbitMQ bad Ack responses
    -   Previously: `BasicReturn for TEST.IdentifiableImageExchange`
    -   Now :
        `BasicReturn for Exchange 'TEST.IdentifiableImageExchange' Routing Key 'reprocessed' ReplyCode '312' (NO_ROUTE)`
-   Added new swapper `TableLookupWithGuidFallbackSwapper` which performs lookup
    substitutions but allocates guids for lookup misses
-   Added Travis CI build & deploy for all services

### Changed

-   Make exceptions on startup clearer
-   Updated to latest RDMP API (4.0.1)
-   `TableLookupSwapper` now throws consistent error if the provided table does
    not exist during `Setup` (previously it would error with DBMS specific error
    message at lookup time)

### Fixed

-   Fixed freeze condition when exchanges are not mapped to queues
-   IdentifierMapper now loads all FAnsi database implementations up front on
    startup
